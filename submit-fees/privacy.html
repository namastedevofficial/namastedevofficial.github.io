                <b>How do you get my consent?</b>

                When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, arrange for a delivery or return a purchase, we imply that you consent to our collecting and using it for that specific reason only.

                If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent or provide you with an opportunity to say no.
                <br><br>
                <strong> How do I withdraw my consent?</strong>
                <br>

        <h4>DISCLOSURE</h4>
        <div class="content v">
            <p>
                We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our Terms of Service.

        <h4> PAYMENT</h4>
        <div class="content v">
            <p>
                We use Razorpay for processing payments. We/Razorpay do not store your card data on their servers. The data is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) when processing payment. Your purchase transaction data is only used as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is not saved.
                <br><br>
                Our payment gateway adheres to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover.
                <br><br>
                PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers.
                <br><br>
